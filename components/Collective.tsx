        Abasho Collective exists to change that. Lack of technological
        understanding and misconceptions about NFTs/Crypto keep thousands of
        talented artists from accessing the tremendous opportunities available
        in web3. Abasho Collective is dedicated to identifying, onboarding, and
        equipping emerging artists for success in the digital decentralized
        world.
